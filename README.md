#Electricity Graph

Electricity graph widget for Sciptable, that uses Elering.ee API, which in turn uses NordPool data, in order to display electricity prices from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland. Before use, be sure to edit the first few lines of attributes to accomodate your needs.
The widget has two modes - dark and light mode. The white bar shows the current electricity price, whereas the horizontal dotted line shows the price range (it is set to 10 cents by default).
